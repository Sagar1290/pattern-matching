In most computer vision and image analysis problems, it is necessary to define a similarity measure
between two or more different objects or images. Template matching is a classic and fundamental
method used to score similarities between objects using certain mathematical algorithms. In this
paper, we reviewed the basic concept of matching, as well as advances in template matching and
applications such as invariant features or novel applications in medical image analysis. These
models have broad applications in image registration, and they are a fundamental aspect of novel
machine vision or deep learning algorithms.
